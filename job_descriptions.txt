The Climate Change Committee has estimated that the 3% of UK heat demand provided today by heat networks could grow to around 18% of heat demand by 2050. Ambitious growth targets, and several encouraging upcoming changes in the regulatory landscape, have created exciting opportunities for consultants to be at the forefront of the Net Zero transition.

Lead the technical data management activities relating to subsurface, production, licence, storage site / complex and infrastructure data in related to ET activities
Co-ordination of data QC and loading – including well, storage site / complex and infrastructure data
Work with the Head of Data Services & Compliance to manage data reporting to the NDR and issue of reporting notices
Lead the development of reporting processes, industry guidance and supporting the development of IT applications to support the reporting and disclosure process
Liaise with industry and other stakeholders to ensure the NSTA approach is agreed, understood and contributes to the NSTA Strategy
Manage the interface between data acquired pursuant of Petroleum Licence activities and the role that ‘Petroleum Related’ data will play in fulfilling the NSTA’s objective of assisting the Secretary of State with meeting the net zero target, and support investment in relevant activities
Lead the development of compliance measurement process including process development and support and interaction with licensees
Included in all of the above are matters to do with physical samples and where relevant, matters to do with volumes of carbon dioxide stored and ongoing monitoring activities

Priorities and key challenges
The immediate priorities for the Energy Transition Technical Data Manager are as follows:
Work with key teams to establish data requirements for Energy Transition activities
Review current and emerging data regulations to ensure they are fit for purpose
Raise awareness of the data required to support the Energy Transition working with colleagues across NSTA

About the job
In Flint’s Competition and Regulation practice we use our experience and technical knowledge from senior levels in regulatory authorities to support clients on a broad range of complex issues. For example, we:

support clients in managing competition, state aid or policy concerns that arise from transactions;
help companies understand and manage the impact of (economic) regulation and legislation on their business; and
advise clients on significant strategic and organisational decisions to defend their commercial interests.

Flint Consultants drive the delivery of client work, supporting colleagues in developing business. They support the delivery of intellectual property and provide research to meet the needs of colleagues. You will work closely with Managers, Directors and Partners to advise clients on economic issues, politics, regulation, and commercial strategy. Flint’s clients want to understand, in detail, how they can build a long-term strategy to thrive commercially in a changing increasingly uncertain policy environment.

We work with companies affected by political, policy, or regulatory change. Our clients are senior executives looking to improve the trajectory of their business, or to achieve particular commercial outcomes through policy or regulatory change. Flint helps them to drive their businesses forward.

You will have opportunities to engage with clients at the most senior levels – including Board members and Executive teams – and across a wide range of sectors. You will work with other members of the Flint team to research and analyse the complex policy challenges our clients face and develop options and approaches to address those challenges, backing up recommendations with wider strategic and political analysis. You will also have the chance to work on a range of projects as part of a mixed discipline team.

This is a junior role and will involve some more administrative, organisational and research tasks to support the client teams you work with. However, there will be space to engage in discussion and debates on substantive economic policy and political challenges, as well as significant scope for career progression.

WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR

We are looking for candidates with c.3 years’ work experience of regulatory economics or policy-making in a major regulator, Westminster, Whitehall and/or corporate or investor experience. Alternatively, we are open to outstanding candidates with a Masters in Economics or Finance. Economic concepts and their application are second nature to you, but you also recognise that economics is only part of the answer to complex strategic and policy decisions.

Engaging closely with our UK and international clients across a wide range of sectors, you will have the opportunity to analyse the complex regulatory, competition and wider policy challenges that they face. You will develop options and approaches to address those challenges, backing up recommendations with wider economic, financial, strategic and political analysis. You will also have the opportunity to work on a wider range of projects as part of a mixed discipline team.

We are also open to candidates from commercial background including major consulting houses, investors, etc. with a keen interest in economics, policy and regulation.

KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & EXPERIENCE

We are keen for candidates with experience or skills in any of the following areas, although this is not essential:

Digital, technology and media policy
Telecoms regulation
Economic and industrial policy
Infrastructure policy and regulation
Transport policy and regulation
Private equity and alternative investments
Cyber and defence policy

You will have:

A degree (or higher qualification) in economics or a related discipline.

First class understanding of microeconomic principles and the ability to apply those in a practical way to real world problems – in particular, experience of applying regulatory and/or competition economics in a wider policy-making setting.

Excellent analytical, quantitative, research and problem-solving skills – ability to draw out the implications of complex evidence and analysis to give clear strategy and policy advice.

Outstanding written and oral communication skills, with proven ability to communicate complex economic issues to non-specialists clearly and concisely both face to face and on paper.

Strong organisational skills including the ability to prioritise, plan and schedule complex tasks proactively – comfortable working under pressure and to tight deadlines.

Strong interpersonal skills – a flexible approach and the ability to work well across teams, both with internal colleagues and external clients.

You will bring an understanding of both public and private sectors.


STANDING OUT

To be successful, you will need to demonstrate the following three things in your application:

You are a team player and the kind of colleague who will add to the strong community we are building at Flint.

You have something to say, and that our clients will benefit materially from access to your expertise and your perspective.

You will be driven by achieving outcomes for our clients, and that you can successfully contribute to a fast-paced commercial business.

We are accepting applications until 11:59pm on Friday 27 January. Please note, candidates are encouraged to apply as soon as possible as interviews will be held on a rolling basis where suitable candidates are identified, not necessarily after the closing date.

ABOUT FLINT

WBCSD is the premier global, CEO-led community of over 200 of the world’s leading sustainable businesses working collectively to accelerate the system transformations needed for a net zero, nature positive, and more equitable future.

We do this by engaging executives and sustainability leaders from business and elsewhere to share practical insights on the obstacles and opportunities we currently face in tackling the integrated climate, nature and inequality sustainability challenge; by co-developing “how-to” CEO-guides from these insights; by providing science-based target guidance including standards and protocols; and by developing tools and platforms to help leading businesses in sustainability drive integrated actions to tackle climate, nature and inequality challenges across sectors and geographical regions.
Our member companies come from all business sectors and all major economies, representing a combined revenue of more than USD $8.5 trillion and 19 million employees.

Guided by WBCSD’s Vision 2050, the Energy Pathway work aims to create a sustainable energy system which provides reliable and affordable net-zero carbon energy for all.
