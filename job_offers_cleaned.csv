Solar Consultant,Everoze,"Bristol, England, United Kingdom",Hybrid,"About the job
Everoze is different, we are employee owned. We’re more than just a technical and commercial consultancy, specialising in renewables, storage, green hydrogen and wider energy flexibility. We live our values. We’re passionate about accelerating the transition to a decarbonised energy system. We have no bosses or formal hierarchy. We are free to pursue opportunities that deliver our strategy. We take ownership of our own development and support one another along the way. Our pay is transparent and set by our peers. We, the employees, own the company and we share profits equally.

We’re OK with being different. Everoze isn’t for everyone. But it might just be for you…

We’re excited to be hiring a Senior or Principal German-speaking solar consultant.

Package: A competitive basic salary related to your experience, plus pension, annual profit share and route into company ownership.
Deadline for applications: 5th February 2023.
Location: Preference for any of our offices (Bristol, Glasgow, Madrid, Lyon or Paris). Remote working possible.
Hours: Normal office hours with a healthy level of flexibility. Preference for 5 days per week but will consider candidates who would prefer part-time with a minimum of 3 days per week.

How will you make an impact?
You will be advising developers, owners, investors and lenders on solar / energy storage projects of all scales, through technical and commercial consultancy services. We mainly work in the UK, France Spain, Portugal and Italy. Due to the increasing demand in Germany for bespoke technical services we are looking for a German-speaker to serve this market– with the opportunity to work in different technologies and further afield depending on language ability. The aim is to continue to focus on bespoke consulting services together with our current German speaking team which is primarily based outside of Germany. You would be conducting site visits in Germany on behalf of the Team.

Specific activities will include:
Due diligence. Examining multiple aspects of projects covering the technology, design, project agreements, contracts, financial model etc. The purpose of your review will be to check that the projects are coherent and to identify techno-commercial risks. Your review work feeds into the acquisition and financing of projects, portfolios or companies and you will be in direct communication with the project developer and the financial institutions involved;
Project support. Supporting project developers in the process of specifying and procuring equipment, construction and operational monitoring, reviewing detailed designs, contract review and drafting support for typical renewable energy sector construction and operation contracts from a techno-commercial perspective;
Site visits. Visiting sites to witness on-site testing, check the quality of builds and liaise with the owner, operator and contractors to follow progress and identify design or construction issues;
Strategic. Advising clients on the risks and opportunities of entry into energy markets across Europe;
Winning work. Building client relationships and expanding our business;
Taking the lead. On the above types of projects, taking on a Project Manager or Project Director role on large and complex projects;
Entrepreneurship. Identifying and pursuing strategic opportunities to expand Everoze’s services; and
Ownership of budget and profitability of projects.

We offer
We are owned by the employees and offer a route into ownership for all new staff;
Real impact: We work with some of the biggest brands in the energy sector. We are regularly asked to share our thought leadership at the sector’s top conferences. You could be at the heart of this: conducting analysis which informs major investment and policy decisions;
Exposure: We work with clients ranging from multinational banks to international investors to community energy groups. You will be exposed to the wide range of projects financed and developed by these clients and you’ll work closely with them to address new challenges and opportunities at each turn;
A fast-growth environment: We set up shop with 6 partners in September 2015. Now we’re 75 strong and counting, based across the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and Germany;
The flattest of flat organisations: Let’s be upfront: if you thrive on hierarchy and structure, Everoze isn’t the company for you. But if you are looking for a work environment where the strength of your ideas are valued as much as your years of experience, then welcome home. You’ll be given the freedom and autonomy to shape your own career; it’s not for everyone, and with freedom comes responsibility – but we sure enjoy the buzz of owning our own careers;
The team works: Goodbye departmental silos! We get our offshore wind experts working on energy storage, our UK team working on French projects, our onshore wind specialists branching into solar. It keeps things fresh for us and more importantly, spurs the creative cross-fertilisation of ideas which helps us deliver unique insights and value to our clients;
Top-notch mentorship: Most of us at Everoze have been in the renewables and energy business for well over a decade, and some of us have previously led large teams and business units. We’d love to share some of this experience, through assigning you an internal mentor to help guide your professional development. And we hope that you can return the favour by offering feedback for us too, because whether you’ve got 3 months experience, or 30 years, we’ve all got more to learn;
No utilisation targets: yes that’s right! we don’t report on, or check staff utilisation to assess team or individual performance. We operate on trust within the team. We find that happy and motivated staff are able to find the right balance between commercial work, business development and administration;
Flexibility: we offer flexible work hours, part-time and remote working for those who want it;
Fostering entrepreneurship: If you have a good idea for a new business area, we empower you to follow it. OK, lots of companies say that, right? Well, many of our staff are actively involved in new ventures which have led to creating new companies or lines of work. We’re serious about this and we have systems for selecting new opportunities and a budget for investing in them.

We would like to hear from you if you meet the following requirements:

Data Management Expert – Energy Modelling,Baringa,"London Area, United Kingdom",Hybrid,"About the job
Data Management Expert - Energy Modelling

Overview

We set out to build the world’s most trusted consulting firm – creating lasting impact for clients and pioneering a positive, people-first way of working. We work with everyone from FTSE 100 names to bright new start-ups, in every sector.

You’ll find us collaborating shoulder-to-shoulder with our clients, from the big picture right down to the detail: helping them define their strategy, deliver complex change, spot the right commercial opportunities, manage risk or bring their purpose and sustainability goals to life. Our clients love how we get to know what makes their businesses tick – slotting seamlessly into their teams and being proudly geeky about solving their challenges.

We have hubs in Europe, the US, Asia and Australia, and we work all around the world – from a wind farm in Wyoming to a boardroom in Berlin. Find us wherever there’s a challenge to be tackled and an impact to be made.

Baringa believe that diversity is paramount to driving creativity, innovation, and value for our clients and for our people, and creating an environment where everyone feels a sense of belonging is central to our culture.

What will you be doing?

Baringa has modelling capability across climate risk, energy transition and power markets providing forward-looking scenarios and price projections to support policy formation, investment decisions and corporate strategies. Our quarterly reports are distributed to hundreds of clients in over 30 markets around the world. The capability rests on the deep technical, economic, and political insight provided by our Market Expert community, and is realised through quantitative models dependent on high-quality, up-to-date market data.

We are now recruiting to bring data management expertise into our modelling teams.

So, what are we looking for?

We Are Looking To Recruit Data Management Experts To Work With The Market Expert Community, To Understand And Drive Consistency In How Insights And Data Are Collated, Stored, And Shared

We recruit individuals at all levels based on merit. Don't worry about 'fitting into a quota'; if you can demonstrate some of the skills we are after we would love to hear from you.

Develop clear processes for governing data sources and supporting materials for their implementation.
Ensure that sources are documented clearly, and enable their reuse across the team
Review any risks associated with using datasets including intellectual property risks
Establish criteria for assessing the quality of data sources and support the team by curating sources
Create a repository of key data sources providing up-to-date and high-quality data
Train new team members and supporting them with improving and documenting their research
Organise shared data sets and the team’s archive, to ensure data are accessible, traceable, and auditable.

Experience working on managing, classifying, and organising large sets of structured and unstructured data in fields like clinical medical trials or academic research projects would certainly be applicable to the role.

Familiarity with data management tools such as databases (including knowledge of SQL) and data management with Python or R would be desirable, but not essential.

Some knowledge of data warehousing (particularly under Microsoft Azure) and unstructured data management principles would also be an advantage.

If you are someone with the skills to help and are passionate about the energy transition and climate change, we would love to hear from you! Experience in energy markets is helpful but not essential. Your key contribution to the team comes from your organisational approach.

So, what's in it for you?

Well, it’s up to you. Baringa is what you make it.

Promotion is solely based on your own performance, and we give you every opportunity to progress by having four promotional reviews a year
We’re proud to put people first with wellbeing at the forefront of our culture, one example of this is that every employee receives £300 a year to put towards their wellbeing! In 2022 this was recognised in our #1 ranking in the UK’s Great Place To Work 'Best Workplaces for Wellbeing'.
All employees participate in the Baringa Group Profit Share Scheme, which seeks to ensure that everyone has a stake in the success of the company.
We recognise everyone needs a well-deserved break - As such we have introduced the ‘Re-charge’ benefit meaning Baringa will offer all employees an additional 2 weeks of paid leave after 5 years continuous service.
Lastly, we recognise the importance of work-life balance and we know that the ‘ideal’ balance will vary from person to person and will change at different stages of our working lives. If you require flexible working, please talk to one of our Recruiters about the flexibility you may need.

Diversity & Inclusion

All applications will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, ethnicity, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, nationality, disability, age, faith or social background. We are proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer.

Ours is an environment of outperformance. We achieve this not with targets and incentives, but by fostering a positive, supportive, fair and open atmosphere. We respect and value difference but insist on inclusivity. We celebrate all aspects of diversity and challenge any form of bias, because we want everyone to feel that they belong. This is vital to our ability to work as one team, with a common mind-set.

We recognise that one size does not fit all. Our goal is to embed flexibility across our firm by giving everyone the opportunity to work in an agile way, whether as a regular pattern or on an ad hoc basis, and we will be happy to discuss this further.

The successful candidate will join an interdisciplinary team that contributes to the firm’s delivery of sustainability activity and will report directly to the Sustainability Director. The Sustainability function’s wider role is to ensure that the firm is meeting stakeholder expectations as a responsible business whether that is carbon emissions, diversity, human rights, compliance, or any other aspect of being a credible corporate citizen. This role will support the Sustainability Director in driving this wider agenda, focusing on key workstreams to deliver meaningful progress and working closely with functions including ESG and Pro bono Practice Groups, Regulatory Risk, Innovation, Business Development and Marketing, Environment, Sourcing and Business Change.

Effective written and verbal communication, especially in creating reports/papers and presentations
Evidence of using own initiative to drive work, explore new paths, test new ideas and loop in new people
An ambition and appetite to grow a career in sustainability

Work closely with strategy teams to embed sustainability priorities and initiatives within the firm’s refreshed strategy and
Produce project plans for sustainability workstreams and initiatives
Contribute to pitches and bespoke client requests relating to the firm’s sustainability initiatives and deliver added value through non-legal sustainability know-how and experience
Work with the ESG and Practice Innovation Teams to test and prototype new sustainability product and service development processes
Support the firm’s sustainability disclosure and reporting efforts (TCFD, UNGC, CDP etc)
Routinely update internal and external sustainability communication materials
Support other strands of the sustainability agenda as required, for example community investment and recruitment initiatives such as youth summits and workshops

Experience Required

Direct engagement in two or more aspects of the wider sustainability agenda such as human rights, diversity & inclusion, health & wellbeing, climate change, social impact, risk management…
Direct experience of submitting key data and narrative whether for index returns, questionnaires or simply in response to client or other external requests
Evidence of effective operation within a corporate setting, especially focused upon influencing skills, networking and involvement in governance
Excellent communication skills to include paper/report writing, preparation of slide decks and drafting of internal news. Experience of presenting to internal audiences (essential) and external (preferable) is also important.

The Team

The central small team includes two roles focusing on sustainability (including this post) as well as four working on community investment and four on pro bono (collectively ‘Social Impact’). Though often seen as the ‘friendly face’ of the firm, these roles are increasingly influential and performance expectations are therefore high. The team enjoys good access to senior people and with this comes responsibility for effective communication and swift turnarounds. With one foot inside and one foot outside the firm, it is privileged opportunity to see our business ‘in the round’ and to network with colleagues across the firm and counterparts across our client base.
