You will have the freedom to decide what Heat and Local Energy policy areas to focus on, and you would lead on the delivery of these projects from conception through to final deliverables. With that in mind you will use your first class analytical, report writing and presentation skills to ensure that the intended recipients can be engaged effectively and easily get to grips with the content generated.

It will be great if you already have leadership/line management experience, as this opportunity will head up a small team of one to two, however this is not a prerequisite if you have the attributes and the ambition to do so.

This will be complemented by strong quantitative analytical capabilities and report writing and presentation skills that allow you to understand, interpret, and effectively communicate policy and regulatory outputs and their wider implications. You will be working with a wide range of stakeholders, mainly on collaborative projects so you will also be capable of quickly developing effective working relationships.

We offer
We are owned by the employees and offer a route into ownership for all new staff;
Real impact: We work with some of the biggest brands in the energy sector. We are regularly asked to share our thought leadership at the sector’s top conferences. You could be at the heart of this: conducting analysis which informs major investment and policy decisions;
Exposure: We work with clients ranging from multinational banks to international investors to community energy groups. You will be exposed to the wide range of projects financed and developed by these clients and you’ll work closely with them to address new challenges and opportunities at each turn;
A fast-growth environment: We set up shop with 6 partners in September 2015. Now we’re 75 strong and counting, based across the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and Germany;
The flattest of flat organisations: Let’s be upfront: if you thrive on hierarchy and structure, Everoze isn’t the company for you. But if you are looking for a work environment where the strength of your ideas are valued as much as your years of experience, then welcome home. You’ll be given the freedom and autonomy to shape your own career; it’s not for everyone, and with freedom comes responsibility – but we sure enjoy the buzz of owning our own careers;
The team works: Goodbye departmental silos! We get our offshore wind experts working on energy storage, our UK team working on French projects, our onshore wind specialists branching into solar. It keeps things fresh for us and more importantly, spurs the creative cross-fertilisation of ideas which helps us deliver unique insights and value to our clients;
Top-notch mentorship: Most of us at Everoze have been in the renewables and energy business for well over a decade, and some of us have previously led large teams and business units. We’d love to share some of this experience, through assigning you an internal mentor to help guide your professional development. And we hope that you can return the favour by offering feedback for us too, because whether you’ve got 3 months experience, or 30 years, we’ve all got more to learn;
No utilisation targets: yes that’s right! we don’t report on, or check staff utilisation to assess team or individual performance. We operate on trust within the team. We find that happy and motivated staff are able to find the right balance between commercial work, business development and administration;
Flexibility: we offer flexible work hours, part-time and remote working for those who want it;
Fostering entrepreneurship: If you have a good idea for a new business area, we empower you to follow it. OK, lots of companies say that, right? Well, many of our staff are actively involved in new ventures which have led to creating new companies or lines of work. We’re serious about this and we have systems for selecting new opportunities and a budget for investing in them.
